### Universal Agentic Operating System

**Not a chatbot. A team.**

```
Chat AI                          JARVIS
──────────────────────────────   ──────────────────────────────────────
One model, no memory         →   63 specialists + layered memory
Forgets everything each chat →   Remembers goals, decisions, rules
Hallucinated stats & facts   →   Claims verified before delivery
Fails silently               →   Self-healing loops, 5-attempt recovery
Gets worse at edge cases     →   MetaClaw: every failure becomes a rule
You manage the process       →   Orchestrator routes, specialists execute
```

## Why This Exists

Every AI tool puts you in the orchestrator seat — you decide which model, what context to paste, what to carry across sessions, when to switch tools. For a system that's supposed to be working _for_ you, that's a lot of operator work.

JARVIS flips it. You say what you want in plain language. An orchestrator routes the request to the right specialist. The specialists have their own tools, their own memory, and their own rules. The system extracts a lesson from every failure and never makes the same mistake twice.

It's not an assistant. It's a team that happens to live inside Claude Code.

---

## ⚡ What JARVIS Does

| You say... | JARVIS does... |
|-----------|----------------|
| `"Research [topic]"` | 6-phase pipeline: scope → search → screen → extract → synthesize → deliver with citations |
| `"Write a post about [X]"` | Drafts in your voice for any platform, claims fact-checked before delivery |
| `"Build an app that does [X]"` | 25-prompt, 7-day build: PRD → stack → auth → backend → payments → launch |
| `"Automate [workflow]"` | Designs + deploys n8n/Zapier workflows with self-healing error handling |
| `"Morning briefing"` | Calendar, priorities, inbox summary, project status — in under 60 seconds |
| `"Analyze my competitors"` | Validated competitive briefs — no hallucinated pricing or fake data |
| `"Monitor [condition] and alert me"` | Watches continuously, sends proactive iMessage/Slack/email alerts |
| `"Build a landing page for [X]"` | 2026-tier animated HTML — depth, motion, conversion-optimized |
| `"Prep me for my meeting with [name]"` | Pulls context, drafts talking points, formats agenda |
| `"Review this code"` | Multi-specialist review: quality + security + language-specific patterns |

## 🥊 How It Compares

|  | JARVIS | Bare Claude Code | Cursor / Copilot | Aider | CrewAI / LangGraph |
|--|--------|------------------|------------------|-------|--------------------|
| **Primary use** | Any knowledge work | Coding | IDE coding | Pair-programming | Build-your-own agents |
| **Specialist roster** | ✅ 63 + 47 ECC engineers | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Build yourself |
| **Persistent memory** | ✅ 4-layer lazy load | ⚠️ project files | ❌ | ❌ | Build yourself |
| **Learns from failures** | ✅ MetaClaw | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Works out of the box** | ✅ Clone + run | ✅ Clone + run | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ (framework) |
| **Scope** | Research, content, build, analyze, schedule | Coding tasks | Coding tasks | Coding tasks | Whatever you build |

JARVIS is built **on top of** Claude Code — so you get Claude Code's strengths plus routing, memory, and a pre-loaded specialist team.

## 🧠 The Memory System

JARVIS never asks the same question twice. Memory is stored in structured, capped markdown files — loaded lazily so they don't bloat every conversation.

```
Session Start
│
├── L0 — Identity (~200 tokens) ········· ALWAYS loaded
│   └── Who you are, archetype, working style
│
├── L1 — Critical Facts (~300 tokens) ··· ALWAYS loaded
│   └── Active focus, constraints, preferences
│
├── L2 — Domain Context ················· Loaded when relevant
│   ├── memory/context.md   → projects, clients, tools
│   ├── memory/decisions.md → past decisions + rationale
│   └── memory/learnings.md → extracted patterns
│
└── L3 — Deep History ··················· Loaded on recovery only
    └── relationships, domain files, soul.md
```

**At session end**, JARVIS evaluates what it learned and writes updates to the appropriate layer. The index rebuilds automatically.

```bash
# BM25 search across all memory files (built-in, no external DB)
python3 memory/memory_search.py "what did we decide about pricing" --top 3
python3 memory/memory_search.py "CRM tool decision" --top 5
```

## 🧬 MetaClaw — The Self-Improvement Loop

```

```

JARVIS ships with **pre-loaded lessons** from real-world usage — tool routing decisions, workflow architecture patterns, app-building gotchas, and prompt engineering rules already baked in from day one.

---

## 👤 Who It's For

JARVIS asks 3 questions on first run and configures itself for your archetype. No manual setup.

| Archetype | Primary Focus | Core Agents |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| 🏢 **Business Owner** | Pipeline, clients, revenue, market intel | researcher, finance, analyst, content-creator |
| 💼 **Solopreneur** | Projects, invoicing, client comms, scheduling | scheduler, finance, content-creator |
| 🎨 **Creator** | Content pipeline, platform strategy, monetization | content-creator, researcher, analyst |
| 👩‍💻 **Developer** | Code, architecture, automation, debugging | builder + full ECC sub-team |
| 🔬 **Researcher** | Deep research, literature review, citations | researcher (deep pipeline) |
| 🎓 **Student** | Study planning, research, writing | researcher, scheduler |
| 👔 **Executive** | Strategic briefings, team coordination | researcher, analyst, scheduler |
| 🏠 **Personal** | Calendar, tasks, goals, life organization | scheduler, researcher |

---

## 🚀 Setup

### Prerequisites
- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) — requires Claude Pro or API key

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChrisJDiMarco/jarvis-universal.git ~/jarvis
cd ~/jarvis && claude
```

JARVIS detects first run automatically and walks you through 3 questions:

```
JARVIS: What's your name, and in one sentence — what do you do?
JARVIS: What's your main goal right now?
JARVIS: What tools do you use day-to-day?
```

After about two minutes, JARVIS has populated memory, activated the right agents, and is ready to work.

---

## 🔌 MCP Integrations (Optional — Unlocks Full Power)

MCPs give JARVIS direct API access to your tools, replacing slower browser automation.

| MCP | What it unlocks |
|-----|----------------|
| 📧 **Gmail** | Read threads, draft replies, search inbox |
| 📅 **Google Calendar** | Query events, create meetings, meeting prep |
| 📝 **Notion** | Search + write your workspace |
| 💬 **Slack** | Send messages, read channels, search |
| 🔍 **Firecrawl** | Web scraping + search — core research tool |
| 🔄 **n8n** | Trigger + manage automation workflows |
| 🗂 **Google Drive** | Pull docs into research and briefings |
| 📱 **iMessage / SMS** | Proactive alerts to your phone |

> **Install**: each MCP has its own setup flow. Browse the official server list at [modelcontextprotocol/servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) and Claude Code's MCP docs at [docs.claude.com/claude-code/mcp](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp). Generic shape: `claude mcp add <name> -- <command>`.

> **Tier priority**: Direct MCP → automation workflow → browser automation → manual. JARVIS always uses the fastest available path.

## 💬 Examples

<details>
<summary><b>🔬 Deep Research</b></summary>

Ask for a deep dive and you get a 6-phase pipeline, not a one-shot answer:

1. **Scope** — JARVIS restates the question and flags ambiguities
2. **Search** — 6-10 parallel queries across sources
3. **Screen** — filter to high-signal sources, discard junk
4. **Extract** — pull claims, stats, quotes with citations
5. **Synthesize** — build the narrative, flag gaps
6. **Deliver** — 1,500–3,000 word report with source list + confidence levels

Claims that can't be verified get flagged with `[unverified]` instead of being silently presented as fact.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🔨 Building an App</b></summary>

The `vibecode-app-builder` skill runs a 25-prompt process over 7 working days:

- **Day 1** — PRD, stack decision, schema
- **Day 2** — File structure + auth
- **Day 3** — Core feature + self-healing integrations
- **Day 4** — Dashboard + UI polish
- **Day 5** — Payments (Stripe)
- **Day 6** — Mobile-friendly polish
- **Day 7** — Deploy + monitoring

Every step runs through the self-healing executor: build → test → diagnose → repair → retry, up to 5 iterations before escalating to you.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🧬 Self-Improvement in Action</b></summary>

A real pattern from usage:

> JARVIS tries Firecrawl on a G2 review page → rate-limited → falls back to Chrome scrape → succeeds.
>
> MetaClaw extracts the lesson:
> - **Rule:** G2/Capterra review pages rate-limit Firecrawl — use Chrome scrape instead
> - **Confidence:** HIGH
> - **Stored in:** `skills/learned/tool-routing.md`
>
> Next time anyone asks JARVIS to scrape G2, it goes straight to Chrome. The failure never repeats.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>📅 Morning Briefing</b></summary>

A single `"morning briefing"` returns:

- Today's calendar (events with prep notes attached for each)
- Active priorities from memory (with blocker status)
- Owners-inbox items awaiting your review
- Outstanding items from yesterday that didn't close

Designed to replace the first 10 minutes of every morning.

## 🔧 Hiring New Agents

JARVIS comes with 63 agents — but you can add more any time:

```
"I need an agent that handles customer onboarding emails.
They should draft sequences based on user behavior and
integrate with our CRM."
```

JARVIS writes the `.md` file, adds it to the roster, and briefs you on capabilities. Takes about 30 seconds.

---

## 🛣 Roadmap

- **Voice layer** — primary interaction through the `voice-agent-builder` pattern
- **Multi-device sync** — memory accessible across desktop, mobile, and server deployments
- **Community skill registry** — contribute a skill, everyone inherits it

---

## 💡 Philosophy

> *Five principles that drive every design decision.*

**1 — Route, don't execute.** The orchestrator never does domain work directly. It delegates to specialists. Context stays clean, outputs stay high-quality.

**2 — Memory is sacred.** The system is only as good as what it remembers. Memory files are capped, structured, and maintained carefully — so information stays current and never bloats.

**3 — Self-improve or stagnate.** JARVIS extracts lessons from every failure. The MetaClaw system turns mistakes into permanent rules. It's not just an assistant — it's a learning system.

**4 — Plan before executing.** For any task over 3 steps, JARVIS proposes a plan first. For significant work, it writes a Requirement Document. Wasted execution is worse than wasted planning.

**5 — The most direct tool wins.** Direct MCP over browser automation. Specific API over general search. Fastest reliable path — always.

---
